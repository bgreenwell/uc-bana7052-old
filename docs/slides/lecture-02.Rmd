# Properties of $\widehat{\beta}_1$

.large[

* Recall from the previous lecture that LS estimation provides the best linear unbiased estimates .blue[(BLUE)] of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$; namely, $\widehat{\beta}_0$ and $\widehat{\beta}_1$

    - Unbiased since $E\left[\widehat{\beta}_0\right] = \beta_0$ and $E\left[\widehat{\beta}_1\right] = \beta_1$

    - Best in the sense that $\widehat{\beta}_0$ and $\widehat{\beta}_1$ have the smallest .purple[variance] among all other **linear unbiased** estimators of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, respectively

]

--

.large[

* So what is $Var\left[\widehat{\beta}_0\right]$ and $Var\left[\widehat{\beta}_1\right]$?

]


---

# Properties of $\widehat{\beta}_1$

.large[

* Recall that the LS estimate of the slope is a weighted average of the (observed) response values: $\widehat{\beta}_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n w_iY_i$ 

]

--

.large[

* Since the $Y_i$ are independent, it follows that 

.small[

$$Var\left(\widehat{\beta}_1\right) = Var\left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_iY_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2Var\left(Y_i\right) = \dots = \sigma^2 / S_{xx}$$

]

---

# Sampling distribution of $\widehat{\beta}_1$

.large[

* Assuming $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$, then $\widehat{\beta}_1 \sim ???$ `r emo::ji("thinking")`

]

--
 
.large[

* $\widehat{\beta}_1 \sim N\left(\beta_1, \sigma^2/S_{xx}\right)$

]

--

.large[

* But we generally don't know $\sigma^2$, so how do we estimate it?

]

--

.large[

* Replace $\sigma^2$ with its point estimate ($\widehat{\sigma}^2 = MSE$), and the sampling distribution of $\widehat{\beta}_1$ becomes $\widehat{\beta}_1 \stackrel{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(\beta_1, \widehat{\sigma}^2/S_{xx}\right)$

]


---

# Standard errors

.large[

* .purple[The standard deviation of an estimate is referred to as its *standard error*]. For example,

$$\sqrt{Var\left(\widehat{\beta}_1\right)} = SE\left(\widehat{\beta}_1\right) = \sigma/\sqrt{S_{xx}}$$

]

--

.large[

* Since we don't know $\sigma^2$, we estimate $SE\left(\widehat{\beta}_1\right) = \sigma/\sqrt{S_{xx}}$ with its *plug-in* estimate

$$\widehat{SE}\left(\widehat{\beta}_1\right) = \widehat{\sigma}/\sqrt{S_{xx}}$$

# Inference regarding $\beta_1$

* Hypothesis test: $H_0: \beta_1 = c \quad vs \quad H_1: \beta_1 \ne c$

--

* Test statistic: $$t_{obs} = \frac{\widehat{\beta}_1 - c}{\widehat{SE}\left(\widehat{\beta}_1\right)} = \frac{\widehat{\beta}_1 - c}{\widehat{\sigma} / \sqrt{S_{xx}}}$$

--

* Rejection $H_0$ whenever $\left|t_{obs}\right| \ge t_{n - 2, 1 - \alpha/2}$

    - In R, $t$ quantiles can be obtained using `qt(1 - alpha/2, df = n-2)`, for example
    
```{r qt}
alpha <- 0.05           # significance level
n <- 30                 # sample size         
qt(1 - alpha/2, n - 2)  # cutoff value        #<<
```

--

* A $\left(1-\alpha\right)$ 100% confidence interval for $\beta_1$ is given by $\widehat{\beta}_1 \pm t_{n - 2, 1 - \alpha/2}\widehat{\sigma}/S_{xx}$

```{r 01-crystal-solution-02}
# Compute a 90% CI for the slope
confint(crystal_fit, parm = "time", level = 0.9)

Since 3/4 lies outside of the 90% confidence interval for $\beta_1$, we reject the null hypothesis at the 0.1 level and conclude that the slope significantly differs from 3/4.

Since $p < 0.1$, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the slope significantly differs from 3/4.

.large[

* It is easy to show that the sums of these squared deviations have the same relationship: $$\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n\left(\widehat{Y}_i - \bar{Y}\right) + \sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i\right)$$

# Estimation versus prediction

* Regression models are often used to predict a new response or estimate a mean
response for a given value of the predictor $X$

* We have seen how to compute a predicted value $\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 X$

     - However, as with any estimate, we need a measure of reliability associated with $\widehat{Y}_0$.

* The fitted regression line for the `r emo::ji("rocket")` example is given by $$\widehat{Y} = 2627.822 - 37.154 X$$ where $X$ is the age in weeks of the rocket and $Y$ is its psi strength

* Suppose we want to predict the strength of a new rocket at an age of 15 weeks. Then we would simply plug $X = 15$ into the estimated regression equation to get a predicted value of $\widehat{Y} = 2627.822 − 37.154(15) = 2070.512$ (psi).


---

# Estimation versus prediction `r emo::ji("confused")`

* Regression analysis is really a problem of estimating a conditional mean or expectation, for example, in SLR we have $$E\left(Y|X\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$$

* Here, $E\left(Y|X\right)$ corresponds to the average value of the response $Y$ for all
units in the population with a specific $X$ value

* Suppose we want to estimate the mean strength of .bold[all rockets] with an age of 15 weeks

    - For the prediction problem, we want to predict the strength of a **single rocket** at 15 weeks
    
    - For the estimation problem, we want to estimate the mean of the population of all rockets that are 15 weeks old 
    
    - In both cases, we use $\widehat{Y} = 2070.512$ as the predicted strength and as the estimate of the mean strength of of rockets that are 15 weeks old

--

.center[.small[.content-box-yellow[

In other words, the point estimate is the same for prediction and estimation, the difference lies in the estimated standard error of each!

]


---

# Estimation versus prediction

* There is more uncertainty associated with prediction a single new observation (**Why?** `r emo::ji("thinking")`)

* For a given value of $X$, it is customary to compute **confidence intervals for an estimated mean response** and a **prediction interval for a single new response value**

* The idea of a prediction interval is to determine an interval that will contain a certain percentage of the population

    - Because a prediction interval is attempting to capture a single, random future response, as opposed to the mean of the conditional population, it will be wider than the associated confidence interval

In SLR, there is a connection between $R^2$ and the Pearson correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$: $$r = \pm \sqrt{R^2}$$
