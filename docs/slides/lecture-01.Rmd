---

# Pearson correlation

.font160[

* The (Pearson) correlation coefficient (also called the *Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient*) between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by 

$$Cor\left(X, Y\right) = \rho = \frac{Cov\left(X,Y\right)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$

* Given a sample $\left\{\left(x_i, y_i\right)\right\}_{i=1}^n$, we estimate $\rho$ with $r = S_{xy} / \sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}$

  - Where, for example, $S_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)\left(y_i - \bar{y}\right)$

]


---

# Pearson correlation

.font130[

* It is common to test the hypothesis $H_0: \rho = 0$ vs. $H_1: \rho \ne 0$

    - Rejecting $H_0$ is only evidence that $\rho$ is **not exactly zero**

    - A *p*-value **does not measure the magnitude of the (linear) association**

    - Sample size affects the p-value! `r emo::ji("scream")`

* There is a formal relationship between Pearson's correlation and the *simple linear regression* (SLR) model

    - Simple linear relationships can be described by a *slope* and *intercept*

]


---

# Interpretting correlation(s) `r emo::ji("warning")`

.font150[

* Correlation between $X$ and $Y$ does not imply causation

    - It does not imply the direction of any possible **causal relationship** between $X$ and $Y$
    
    - There might be a third (*lurking*) variable that is the cause of changes in both variables (i.e., the association between $X$ and $Y$ might be indirect)
    
* The Pearson correlation only measures the **linear association **between $X$ and $Y$

1. Simulate $Y_i \stackrel{indep.}{\sim} N\left(\mu = 1 + 2X_i, \sigma = 1.2\right)$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, 30$, where $X_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} U\left(0, 5\right)$

2. Fit an SLR model to the data and estimate the slope and intercept. Do the estimated slope and intercept match closely with the true values? What happens to the estimates if we generate the response from a $N\left(\mu = 1 + 2X_i, \sigma = 0.2\right)$ distribution instead?

# Properties of the residuals

* $\sum_{i=1}^n e_i = 0$ (.purple[**Why?**] `r emo::ji("thinking")`)

* $\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2$ minimizes is a minimum

* $\sum_{i=1}^n X_ie_i = 0$

* $\sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{Y}_ie_i = 0$

* The LS regression line passes through the point $\left(\bar{X}, \bar{Y}\right)$ (i.e., the center of the training data)

* Assuming $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$, we have an additional (unknown) parameter: $\sigma^2$

* How do we estimate $\sigma^2$ (LS estimation only provides estimates for the slope and intercept)?

# Maximum likelihood estimation

.font125[

Since $Y_i \stackrel{indep.}{\sim} N\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_i, \sigma^2\right)$, the *likelihood function* for the data (as a function of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2$) is given by 

$$L\left(\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma^2\right) = \prod_{i=1}^nf\left(Y_i; \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i, \sigma^2\right),$$ where $$f\left(Y_i; \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i, \sigma^2\right) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$ is the *probability density function* (PDF) of a normal distribution with mean $\beta_0 + \beta_1X_i$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

# Maximum likelihood estimation

* Maximizing the likelihood is the same as maximizing the *log-likelihood* $l = \log\left(L\right)$ (**Why?** `r emo::ji("thinking")`)

* The full log-likelihood is given by 

$$l = -\frac{n}{2}\log\left(2\pi\right) - \frac{n}{2}\log\left(\sigma^2\right) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1X_i\right)^2$$

* Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2$ can be found by equating the (partial) derivatives of $l$ to zero:

    - $\frac{\partial l}{\partial \beta_0} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1X_i\right)$
    
    - $\frac{\partial l}{\partial \beta_1} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1X_i\right)$
    
    - $\frac{\partial l}{\partial \sigma^2} = -\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} + \frac{1}{\sigma^4}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1X_i\right)^2$

# Maximum likelihood estimation

.font125[

* As it turns out, the ML estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ (under our current assumptions) are the same as the corresponding LS estimates

* ML estimation, however, provides us with an estimate of the error variance $\sigma^2$ 
$$\widehat{\sigma}_{MLE}^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2$$

* However, since $\widehat{\sigma}_{MLE}^2$ is a biased estimate for the error variance, we use an adjusted estimate

$$\widehat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 = MSE$$

Use the `fitted()`, `residuals()`, and `sigma()` functions to obtain the fitted values, residuals, and RMSE, respectively, for the crystal weight example. Confirm the formula for the residuals.

# Rocket propellant example `r icon::fa_rocket(animate = "spin")`

.font140[

A rocket motor is manufactured by bonding an igniter propellant and a sustainer propellant together inside a metal housing. The shear strength of the bond ( $Y$ )
between the two types of propellant is an important quality characteristic. It is suspected that the shear strength is related to the age ( $X$ ) of the batch of
sustainer propellant. $n = 20$ observations on shear strength (measured in psi) and age (measured in weeks) are available in the file `rocket.csv`. We'll use [this script](https://github.com/bgreenwell/uc-bana7052/blob/master/code/rocket.R) to analyze the data with simple linear regression.
