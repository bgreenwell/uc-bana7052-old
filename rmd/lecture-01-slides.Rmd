```


## Pearson correlation

* The (Pearson) correlation coefficient (also called the *Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient*) between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by $Cor\left(X, Y\right) = \rho = Cov\left(X, Y\right) / \left(\sigma_X\sigma_Y\right)$

* Given a sample $\left\{\left(x_i, y_i\right)\right\}_{i=1}^n$, we estimate $\rho$ with $r = S_{xy} / \sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}$

  - Where, for example, $S_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)\left(y_i - \bar{y}\right)$


## Pearson correlation

* It is common to test the hypothesis $H_0: \rho = 0$ vs. $H_1: \rho \ne 0$

    - Rejecting $H_0$ is only evidence that $\rho$ is **not exactly zero**

    - A *p*-value **does not measure the magnitude of the (linear) association**

    - Sample size affects the p-value! `r emo::ji("scream")`

* There is a formal relationship between Pearson's correlation and the *simple linear regression* (SLR) model

    - Simple linear relationships can be described by a *slope* and *intercept*


## Cautions in interpretting correlation(s)

* Correlation between $X$ and $Y$ does not imply causation

    - It does not imply the direction of any possible **causal relationship** between $X$ and $Y$
    
    - There might be a third (*lurking*) variable that is the cause of changes in both variables (i.e., the association between $X$ and $Y$ might be indirect)
    
* The Pearson correlation only measures the **linear association **between $X$ and $Y$

## Which of the following statement(s) is/are true?

a. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of linear association

b. A non-significant *p*-value for a Pearson correlation means no relationship

c. A negative Pearson correlation indicates a low degree of linear association

d. A random cloud of data implies a negative correlation.

## Historical origins of regression

* First developed by Sir Francis Galton in the later part of the 19th century

* Studied heights of parents and their children

* Noted that the heights of children with tall/short parents tended to "revert" or "regress" to the mean of the group

* The term "regression" persists to this day!


## Historical origins of regression

```{r galton-01, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "HistData"))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(HistData::Galton, aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed") + 
  labs(x = "Height of mid-parent (in)", y = "Height of child (in)")
```


## Historical origins of regression

```{r galton-02, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(HistData::Galton, aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed") + 
  labs(x = "Height of mid-parent (in)", y = "Height of child (in)")
```


## Functional relationships

```{r functional-relation, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 15*1:10), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "red2") +
  labs(x = "Hours worked (X)", y = "Rate of pay (Y)", 
       title = expression(paste("Relation: ", Y == 15 %*% X)))
```


## Statistical relationships

```{r linear-relationships, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
p1 <- ggplot(investr::crystal, aes(x = time, y = weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Time (hours)", 
       y = "Weight (grams)", 
       title = "Crystal weight data")
p2 <- ggplot(investr::arsenic, aes(x = actual, y = measured)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "True amount of arsenic", 
       y = "Measured amount of arsenic",
       title = "Arsenic concentration data")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```


## Examples of statistical relationships

* Simple linear regression (SLR)

    - $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$
    
* Multiple linear regression (MLR)

    - $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon$
    
    - $Y = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_p X_p + \epsilon$
    
 * Polynomial regression (of degree $p$)

    - $Y = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_p X^p + \epsilon$   

 * Nonlinear regression

    - $Y = \frac{\beta_1 X}{\beta_2 + X} + \epsilon$

                 width = 40, type = 2, fps = 10)
```


## Simple linear regression (SLR)

* Data: $\left\{\left(X_i, Y_i\right)\right\}_{i=1}^n$

* Model: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$

    - $Y_i$ is a continuous response

    - $X_i$ is a continuous predictor

    - $\beta_0$  is the intercept of the regression line (also called the *bias term*)

    - $\beta_1$  is the slope of the regression line
    
    - $\epsilon_i \sim iid \left(0, \sigma^2\right)$


## Assumptions about the errors

* For $i/j = 1, 2, \dots, n$

    1. $\quad E\left(\epsilon_i\right) = 0$

    2. $\quad Var\left(\epsilon_i\right) = \sigma^2$ (homoscedacticity `r emo::ji("scream")`)

    3. $\quad Cov\left(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j\right) = 0$ (independence)
    
* Assumptions 1.--3. can be summarized as $\epsilon_i \sim iid \left(0, \sigma^2\right)$
    
    
## Properites of SLR

* Simple linear regression: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$

    - Implies the model is **linear in the regression coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$**
    
* The error term is a random variable; hence, $Y_i$ is also a random variable (**Why?** `r emo::ji("thinking")`)

    - What is $E\left(Y_i|X_i\right)$ and $Var\left(Y_i|X_i\right)$?
    
* $Cor\left(Y_i, Y_j\right) = 0$ $\forall i \ne j$ (**Why?** `r emo::ji("thinking")`)


## The SLR model with normal errors

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, n
$$

<br/>

where $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$, is equivalent to

<br/>

$$
Y_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i, \sigma^2\right), \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, n
$$

* $\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$ is called the *linear predictor* (LP)


## Interpretting the regression coefficients

* $\beta_0$ is the *y*-intercept (or *bias term*)

    - It represent the mean response when $X = 0$; that is $\beta_0 = E\left(Y|X = 0\right)$

    - In general, the intercept is of little practical interest (this is especially true in MLR or when zero is not a valid value of $X$)

* $\beta_1$ is the slope of the regression line

    - The slope of a line represents a *rate of change*
    
    - It represents the change in the mean response per one-unit increase in $X$
